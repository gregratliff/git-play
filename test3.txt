Here is my third text file in my git-play project. 

I'm currently trying to figure out how to do stuff with branches.

I made a branch and merged it locally and pushed main and github has no idea a branch was ever involved.  I want my branches to exist on the remote origin, so I need to figure that out.


I'm just wondering what else I will use nvim and github for once I am a power user?
